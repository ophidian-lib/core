/** use() this to make your plugin support dynamic Style Settings
 *
 * Currently, Obsidian doesn't announce CSS changes when plugins
 * load, so Style Settings doesn't update when you update a plugin
 * or install a new one.  This service takes care of that for you,
 * telling Style Settings to update after a plugin loads its CSS.
 *
 * To take effect, this service must be use()d as a plugin property,
 * or else it will miss the timing to capture the loadCSS event.
